# Arduino Car
	Work in progress...
	Motor and encoder tested
	Other modules were tested in different sketches

#### Own libraries
	Motor
	Encoder

#### Third-party libraries
	Arduino-IRemote
	I2Cdev
	MPU6050
	Messenger
	TimerOne
	ros_lib


#### Hardware
	1 Arduino mega 2560
	2 Dc motors + Quadrature encoders
	2 Sparfun monster moto shields, ST VNH3SP30 H-bridge
	1 MPU6050, GY-521
	1 Ultrasonic sensor, HC-SR04
#### IDE
	This project is developped using Visual studio code (VsCode) and PlatformIO extension.
	The only difference (in the code) between arduino IDE and other IDEs (VsCode, Atom, Eclispe,..) are the forward declaration of functions (prototypes).
